# Exp - 2 LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

# AIM:

To study the problem statement ,SRS document and draw the UML diagram of library management system

# SRS (Procedure):

Create the following diagrams in StarUML:

Use Case Diagram

Class Diagram

Activity Diagram

Package Diagram

Communication Diagram

Sequence Diagram

1 . Students and staff enter the system to search, borrow, return, or renew books.

2 . New users can be added as members by the librarian.

3 . The librarian records all actions, checks reports, and manages book details.

4 . If books are unavailable, the librarian requests them from suppliers.
